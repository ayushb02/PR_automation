## Development Documentation 

## Introduction 

PR Reviewer is an automated GitHub Pull Request review tool that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze PR text and comments. 

In this documentation, we’ll outline the steps to create PR Reviewer. 

 
## Steps: 

#### 1. Project Setup 

  Create a new GitHub repository for PR Review Bot. 
  
      git init

  Set up your development environment (Python, Node.js, etc.). 

      python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment.

#

#### 2. Data Collection 

  Gather labeled PR data (approved, changes asked, etc.). 

  Preprocess the data (tokenization, cleaning, etc.). 

#

#### 3. Model Selection 

  Choose an LLM (e.g., GPT-3, BERT, Gemini, etc.). 

      pip install -q -U google-generativeai

  Fine-tune the model on your PR data. 

#

#### 4. Bot Implementation 

  Develop a script or service that interacts with GitHub’s API. 

      pip install requests

  Authenticate with GitHub using tokens. 

  Listen for new PRs and trigger the bot. 

#

#### 5. PR Analysis 

  When a new PR is opened: 

  Retrieve PR text and comments. 

  Pass them through the LLM for analysis. 

  Determine feedback (approve, request changes, etc.). 

#

#### 6. Bot Responses 

  Based on LLM analysis, provide feedback as comments on the PR. 

  Use natural language to communicate suggestions. 

#

#### 7. Testing and Iteration 

  Test PR Review Bot on sample PRs. 

  Iterate on model performance and adjust thresholds. 

#

#### 8. Deployment 

  Deploy PR Review Bot as a GitHub App or a serverless function. 

  Set up webhooks to trigger the bot. 

#

#### 9. Monitoring and Maintenance 

  Monitor bot performance and adjust as needed. 

  Handle exceptions .
